# Runestone

Welcome to Runestone - a code editor for iOS with focus on performance.

Runestone uses GitHub's [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) to parse code to a syntax tree which is used for features that require an understanding of the code in the editor, for example syntax highlighting.

## Acknowledgments
